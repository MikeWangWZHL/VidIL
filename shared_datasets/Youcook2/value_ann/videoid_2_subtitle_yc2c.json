And then once those are peeled, we're going to quarter them. And to do that will cut it in half. And by the way, the potato tapers a little bit. Always cut the tapered end a little longer. See that I didn't go exactly in half right. That will compensate a little bit for the difference in Girth, so we'll cut him in half, will cut those halves in half, and that's a pretty good method for getting even size pieces.",

'em, that's like double in your work, and yes, it was a long way to go to explain that little spot of dirt on my finger. OK, so once those are rinse thoroughly, we're going to drain him and dump them into our product cold water. They were going to generously solved, by the way, like very generously.

I found some green garlic in the market and I decided to use that. So just like using green onions, I'm pretty much going to use the white and light parts and I'm going to mess it up nice and fine. And again don't feel bad if you don't find green garlic. Regular garlic works extraordinarily well and is incredibly delicious, so don't even worry about it. OK, this is one of those recipes. It's super easy, but you need to get all your ingredients prepped ahead of time, which is called of course meezan plus. OK, so are garlics ready? We're going to set that aside.",

I'm going to put that on medium heat and once it melts, we're going to add our garlic. We're going to give that about a 30 second sizzle, after which I'm going to add my red pepper flakes. I like this a little bit spicy, but you know, I like most things, a little bit spicy, so I'm going to add a big pinch of those. Give that about 15 seconds in the butter.",

You could also grade it on the microplane you've seen as do both many times, so the lemon says goes in. You give that about 30 seconds and then quickly pouring your wine. OK, the wine stops the cooking. We do not want to burn or Brown the garlic so that whole process of Sauteing the garlic pepper and the lemon zest only took about a minute.

So the lids on we're going to give the pod the old Shaker Shaker and let it sit there undisturbed for exactly one minute after one minute, remove the lid, take a spoon and give it a quick stir just like that couple turns.

Your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to a snail that you're going to get at a restaurant, and so you may have seen in a restaurant snails that are served in their shells.

I happen to use a Chinese chef's knife, but if you use a western chefs knife, that's fine. I'm just going to give him a good crack like this, sort of like an egg, and the shell is going to crack apart an again, kind of like an egg.",

If you think you can easily carry it off by adding some more oil you could add it sure or in this case if you want to make it with very less oil you have to keep on sorting this.",

Onion has got a lot of sugar and when it comes in contact with heat like this, it's caramelize is. And that is why Brown onions always stay sweet.",

And of course it also gives a very good flavor to the Curry. Most of the Beriani as you see, have Brown onion as garnish is only because it gives good look at the same time. It also tastes nice and in case of Chicken Curry we have to Brown the onion because in case of onions like this it stays quite raw. It doesn't give a good.",

You'll always notice if onions are left draw as in if they're not really sorted well, they will always separate us and you'll have a tomato gravy on one side and you have the onions on one side, so it is always important to sorted the onions to an extent that it starts brownie.

And then we're also going to need some vinegar, and for this I'm recommending plain white distilled vinegar. And it's not like you're going to wreck this using a different vinegar.
